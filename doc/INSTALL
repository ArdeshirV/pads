Installation
------------
To install PADS, execute the following standard 'autoconf' commands:

	./configure
	make
	make install

Optionally, run './configure --help' for additional command line options.  The following
options may be used:

--disable-vendor	: This option will disable MAC vendor resolution.  This will
			: speed up the application.

--enable-banner-grab	: Compile in the banner grabbing feature.  This feature will
			: dump the asset banners into a libpcap-formatted file.  This
			: feature will help further identify services and will aid in
			: signature development.  Please keep in mind that this will
			: slow down performance

--use-native-pcre	: Use the existing PCRE libraries instead of the ones included.
			: This will shrink the size of the executable.

The libpcap library must be installed before you compile pads.  It can be downloaded from
http://www.tcpdump.org.
