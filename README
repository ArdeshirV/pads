This is a fork of PADS from http://passive.sourceforge.net/
that no longer is beeing updated by Matt Shelton since 2005.

I have clean up a lot of the code, added patch from the 
community and this version should run fine on any modern
*nix system. (Even x86_64 with PIE (Position Independent
Executable) and PaX (least privilege protections for
memory pages in Linux).

I have bumped the version to 1.3 for not to conflict with
the old 1.2 version last released by Matthew J. Shelton.

If you have any thoughts, patches or feature request, I will
do my very best to add them, and to keep this community
version agile and alive.

Best reagards,
Edward Fjellsk√•l <edwardfjellskaal@gmail.com>
